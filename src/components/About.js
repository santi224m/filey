                    transfer a file from one device to another. Usually to do 
                    this, you have to sign in to a cloud storage service on 
                    both devices. If you're using a mobile device, then you may 
                    also have to install an app to do the transfer. Filey 
                    solves this by allowing you to transfer files without 
                    signing in. All you have to do is upload your files on one 
                    device and enter the code you are given on the second 
                    device. You could even download the files on more than one 
                    device if you have to share your files with multiple people."

                        Start by uploading your files from one of the devices.
                        Once you upload your files, you will receive a code that
                        you will use on the other device. Leave this page open
                        while you are transferring your files because once you
                        close the page the files will be deleted and you won't
                        be able to access them on the other device.

                        Once you have uploaded your files and received your code,
                        you can use that code on your other devices. Download
                        the files to your device and close the session when you
                        are done. Closing the session deletes the files so that
                        no one can access them anymore. You can close the
                        session by clicking the "Close Session" button at the
                        bottom of the page or navigating to any other page on
                        the app.
